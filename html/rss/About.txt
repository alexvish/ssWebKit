'ssWebKit' is a simple screensaver based on Qt's (http://qt.nokia.com/) WebKit (http://www.webkit.org/) implementation.

'ssWebKit' is a free software. Screensaver source code is licensed under the terms of 'GPL v3', RSS slideshow is licensed under the terms of 'Apache License v 2.0'

javascript code and styles mostly based on work of html5rocks project:

Also, thanks to user 'spud' of qtcentre.org for his post full of win:

The main purpose of this work is to make a screensaver, capable to show media content of my own rss feeds (my own here means that I have contorl over web server and can publish slideshow.html there).
